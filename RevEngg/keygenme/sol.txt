MY solution : Consider the "Reference" image while considering this solution.
1) Read the code of the file "keygenme-trial.py"
Note: Part of the flag is already given in the "key_part_static1_trial" , "key_part_static2_trial" variable.
2) The only part of the flag that needs to be decoded is "key_part_dynamic1_trial" variable
3) for that go to the "check_key" function.
4) We can see that it takes the username (which in this case is "GOUGH" -> given in the code) and key. The key needs to be given
by the user.
5) Try running the code by giving different keys and see how the program responds. 
6) However, all that is NOT necessary. Read the code. Its the combination of the above 3 variables (static1_trial , static2_trial and dynamic1_trial)

	Therefore, the correct key would be : picoCTF{1n_7h3_|<3y_of_xxxxxxxx} .
However, the program still fails. Why? Because the xxxxx part needs to be decoded.
7) So see the rest of the code. We are using  hashlib function and encoding it and fetching a character at a particular postion and that i 
being replaced at a particular postition of the key.
8) Where is that position. The code mentions it as i = 23. If we notice key[23] is 'x' (starting position of the key that needs to be decoded_
9) Now all I have to do is to replace characters at i=23,24,25.... etc. by performing hashlib operation as shown in the code.
10) That is what I did in the sol_script.py. The array "arr" in the script contains same values as the code part in hashlib function.
11) Run the `sol_script.py` and we get the full key = "picoCTF{1n_7h3_|<3y_of_f911a486}"
